After launching:
- move the toolbar buttons into the first tab: modify and new instead of duplicate and reset
- use a CDN
- use memcache or APC to store versioning info and db requests
- responsiveness, no zooming on mobile
- iframe version: autostart, and add html code to share panel

Nice to have:
- list scripts in a json file
- mess with console.time to get a sense for how slow things are to load on 3g
- not resetting camera position on update, instead add a button to do that. Another one for VR/fullscreen
- use chunking to respond super fast if no data is loaded.


VR:
- need to clean up the vr start/stop
- add an autostart parameter
- figure out why VR breaks after exiting.
- add a fullscreen only button
- reenable auto-rotate
- need HTTPS for fullscreen

Next:
immutable.js and read about flux and redux

Next:
- add a few more struts when necessary.
- make the extra length longer if building a quarter pipe.
- add character.
- create a better background image for the top section. Possibly add a blueprint in the bottom right corner, so that the action button can be made white against blue.
- write a different boundingbox helper for 2d
- add presets for 2d cam positions

Optimizations:
- use a node server to do https/http2
- cache text objects as they are super slow to generate
- use factories and object pools for all object creation, in order to recycle them (replace the geometry, position, scale and rotation).

Mobile:
- Add a darkish background color to all containers with background images.
- switch to em-based font sizes
