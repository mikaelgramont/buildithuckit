quand on clique sur le bouton, faire slider le menu,
set a max height on mobile for the editor
bouger la video sur mobile





sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start

After launching:
- responsiveness, no zooming on mobile
- iframe version: autostart, and add html code to share panel
- use client hints to serve different images: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/09/automating-resource-selection-with-client-hints
- remember units

Nice to have:
- add a clearcache gulp task
- list scripts in a json file
- mess with console.time to get a sense for how slow things are to load on 3g
- not resetting camera position on update, instead add a button to do that. Another one for VR/fullscreen
- having zooming on the 2d view as well. maybe behind a setting, so that things don't jump.
- use chunking to respond super fast if no data is loaded.

VR:
- need to clean up the vr start/stop
- add an autostart parameter
- figure out why VR breaks after exiting.
- add a fullscreen only button
- reenable auto-rotate
- need HTTPS for fullscreen

- try 2nd way of rendering? http://www.slideshare.net/auradeluxe/webgl-the-next-generation

V2.0
- design miniramps
- design quarter pipes
- input radius + angle, or height + angle
- snap to imperial units
- calculate volumes
- assemble more than one object.

Next:
immutable.js and read about flux and redux

Next:
- add a few more struts when necessary.
- make the extra length longer if building a quarter pipe.
- add character.
- create a better background image for the top section. Possibly add a blueprint in the bottom right corner, so that the action button can be made white against blue.
- write a different boundingbox helper for 2d
- add presets for 2d cam positions

Optimizations:
- use a node server to do https/http2
- cache text objects as they are super slow to generate
- use factories and object pools for all object creation, in order to recycle them (replace the geometry, position, scale and rotation).

Mobile:
- Add a darkish background color to all containers with background images.
- switch to em-based font sizes
